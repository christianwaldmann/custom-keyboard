## Steps to build and flash firmware

At the example of flashing a Colemak DH-based layout onto the Ferris Sweep:

1. Prepare environment
    1. Install qmk, for example: `yay qmk`
    2. Run setup: `qmk setup`
2. Compile keymap layout with `./scripts/compile.sh`
3. Flash compiled firmware onto keyboard
    1. Connect 1 half of the keyboard to the PC (remove all other cables)
    2. Enter bootloader mode with the reset button (can also use some wire/paper clip to do this)
    3. Flash firmware: `./scripts/flash.sh`
    4. Repeat steps for the other half of the keyboard
4. Finished. You can now connect all cables of the keyboard and it should work


## Keymap Layout

This layout is based on Colemak DH and assumes the OS is configured to use the "US International" layout.
